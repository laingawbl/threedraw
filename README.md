this is a small node server using express and socket.io. you can start it with `node index.js`.

once the server is up, connect to it through a browser and start drawing. many people can draw 
at once. you can rotate the environment with the left/right keys, and go forward/backward in 
the z-plane with the up/down keys.

unfortunately, there's only one room to draw in, and you can only clear it by restarting the
server.

I made this for the first UVic Hackathing on 04. Nov. 2017.
